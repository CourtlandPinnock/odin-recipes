        <h2>What is French Toast?</h2>
        <p>French toast is a classic dish made from thick sliced bread soaked in mixture of beaten eggs and milk, then pan fried.
           Served with with a wide range of different toppings and additions, from berries to bacon.           
        </p>
        <p> French toast which resembles the dish we know today, has been around since as early as the roman empire.
            In french, the dish is called pain perdu, or "lost bread" harking back to a time where food scarcity was a reality for many. Rather than wasting the bread that had gone stale, it could be used to make pain perdu.
