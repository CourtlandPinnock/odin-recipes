            <h4>For the sauce</h4>

            <li>960ml chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>

            <li>1 pack japanese curry roux</li>
            <li>3 tsp salt</li>

        <ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <li>Cut the onions in half, then either thinly slice or cut into wedges depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Peel and cut the carrotts and potatoes, cutting the potatoes into quarters. To remove excess starch from the potates leave them to soak for roughly 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grate the ginger, and mince the garlic</li>
        <li>Peel and cut the apple into quaters,removing the core. Then grate the apple.</li>
        <li>Remove excess fat and cut the chicken into small pieces. Then season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat and add the onion.</li>
        <li>Saute the onions, occasionally stirring, until they become tender and golden. 6 - 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger and mix together.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock and stir</li>
        <li>Next Add in the grated apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.</li>
        <li>Put in the potatoes and carrots, and simmer for 15 minutes on a medium-low heat. Occasionally stir. (If the ingredients are fully covered by the broth simmer uncovered.)</li>
        <li>Cook until potatoes and carrots are softening.(Enough for a wooden skewer to go through.)</li>
        <li>Take off the heat. In a ladleful of cooking broth, put one or two cubes of roux and slowly dissolve it using a spoon, then stir into the pot. Repeat with the rest of the roux cubes for 8 servings. </li>
        <li>Simmer , on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick. Roughly 5-10 minutes. Make sure nothing is stuck to the bottom of the pot to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>Serve the curry with shortgrain rice on the side.</li>
        <li>Store leftovers in the fridge in a airtight container for up to 3 days, and in the freezer for up to a month. When reheating add some water to dilute the sauce, as it will thicken.</li>
